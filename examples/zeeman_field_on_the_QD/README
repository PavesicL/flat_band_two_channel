Here U >> alpha and epsimp = -U/2 to ensure a single electron in the QD.
Ez_imp is the Zeeman splitting on the QD, which splits the spin up and spin down states.
To see this, turn on doublet_both_Sz=true! This extends the doublet basis to take into both 
Sz=+1/2 and Sz=-1/2 states (only Sz=+1/2 otherwise).
At finite Ec (to remove near-degeneracy of states with different phi) the ground and first excited doublet
states are split by Ez.
